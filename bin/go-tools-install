# go vet - Reports potential errors that otherwise compile.
# go vet --shadow - Reports variables that may have been unintentionally shadowed.
# gotype - Syntactic and semantic analysis similar to the Go compiler.
# deadcode - Finds unused code.

# golint - Google's (mostly stylistic) linter.
# varcheck - Find unused global variables and constants.
# structcheck - Find unused struct fields.
# aligncheck - Warn about un-optimally aligned structures.
# errcheck - Check that error return values are used.
# dupl - Reports potentially duplicated code.
# ineffassign - Detect when assignments to existing variables are not used.
# interfacer - Suggest narrower interfaces that can be used.
# unconvert - Detect redundant type conversions.
# goconst - Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant.
# gosimple - Report simplifications in code.
# staticcheck - Check inputs to functions for correctness

# ## Disabled by default (enable with --enable=<linter>):
# testify - Show location of failed testify assertions.
# test - Show location of test failures from the stdlib testing module.
# gofmt -s - Checks if the code is properly formatted and could not be further simplified.
